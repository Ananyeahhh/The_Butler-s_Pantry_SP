# Butler’s Pantry – Stochastic Optimization Model

This project models a real-world retail distribution problem at The Butler’s Pantry using two-stage stochastic programming. It optimizes product allocation to multiple stores under uncertain demand, considering online pre-orders, emissions, and food waste. The model computes EV, EEV, WSS, VSS, and EVPI for performance analysis. Built in Python using PuLP.
